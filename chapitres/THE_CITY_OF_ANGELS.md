# THE CITY OF ANGELS

In the City of Angels, there’s a magical river

The Gods took them all the power of resurrection

When humans drink the water, they become full of power

But some demons destroy the circle of perfection

---

In the City of Angels, there’s a master and a lot of slaves

The Gods do not worry about the discrimination

The casts are determined, by the color of the shades

Of the windows of their houses and prisons

---

In the City of Angels, the orcs have been banished forever

The Gods don’t like how they decimated the other nations

Only the humans found the strength to surrender

Nobody found the time to take a look to the constellations

---

In the City of Angels, they conquered the dark side of the planet

The gods hate them, but they became allied with them

They contaminated every piece of life that they met

Penetrating their bodies and rotting their brains

---

In the City of Angels, the King is dead last night

The Gods took back what they have given earlier

Now the destiny is their only way for this fight

The moon is burning but nobody worries about her

---

In the City of Angels, heroes do not exist anymore

The Gods watch them, dying the first next fall

They were proud to bless their dead bodies on the floor

But they obviously let them wait and fall.

---

In the City of Angels, the elves are no more immortal

The Gods took back what they have given before

They will no longer respond when we call…

Them to keep an eye on the distant shores.

---

In the City of Angels, the dwarfs work on the mine

The Gods considerate them as small as they are.

They dig all day, all night, but they don’t find

The mithril that would make them win the war.

---

Battle of a bad season

Fight without a reason

Let’s acclaim the first son

Of the Queen of Babylon

---

The place where no one would like to go

The city where no one could survive

The country that has just one law

It’s to stay safe and alife

---

No matter who you are and who you serve

It’s high time for to accept

That’s it's when you win that you deserve

To grow and to climb another step.
